Applicability Domain toolbox for MATLAB - version 1
--------------------------------------------
The Applicability Domain toolbox for MATLAB is a collection of MATLAB modules for calculating the Applicability Domain (AD) of a training set of samples and verify if samples of a test set are inside or outside the AD. The  allows you to calculate AD with the following methods: 
bounding box, bounding box on PCs, convex hull, leverage, distance to centroid, k Nearest Neighbours (kNN) approach with fixed k, k Nearest Neighbours (kNN) approach with variable k, Potential Functions.

This is the version 1.0 of the Applicability Domain toolbox for MATLAB 

Classification toolbox for MATLAB has been released by Milano Chemometrics and QSAR research Group.

--------------------------------------------
INSTALLING THE TOOLBOX
--------------------------------------------
MATLAB should be installed, while the Statistics Toolbox is needed to compute some of the AD methods. In order to install the toolbox, simply copy the files to a folder (e.g. "AD toolbox for MATLAB"). Then, in order to use it, select the same folder as MATLAB current directory.


--------------------------------------------
STARTING CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------
Before starting calculations, please read the HELP files provided in HTML format.
A complete guide on how to calculate AD is provided.

WARRANTY
--------------------------------------------
In short, no guarantees, whatsoever, are given for the quality of this toolbox or for the consequences of its use. 
It is inevitable that there will be some bugs, but we have tried to test the algorithms thoroughly.
