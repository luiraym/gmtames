# Using `gmtamesAD_script.m` with the Applicability Domain Toolbox

1. Use 7-Zip (or your favourite file archiver) to extract `/ad_calc/ad_toolbox.rar`. This should uncompress the Toolbox into the folder `/ad_calc/applicability domain toolbox`.
2. Copy and paste `/ad_calc/gmtamesAD_script.m` into `/ad_calc/applicability domain toolbox`.
3. Open MATLAB (R2022b was used for this project) and set the current folder to `/ad_calc/applicability domain toolbox`.
4. Open `/ad_calc/applicability domain toolbox/gmtamesAD_script.m` and press "Run" in the Editor toolbar
5. The script will automatically create a folder `/ad_calc/gmtamesAD_results` in which the applicability domain results for each strain and val/test sets are saved.
